# N-body simulation 1.0.1

The current version is a simple planetary model (Not to scale) simulation which tries to mimic the real world. It is the C++ raylib version of Tech with Tims python model.
Im planning to expand it in a future release where simulations of n-body systems with arbitary locations can be produced.

+ Fixed the flinging issue when two bodies collide.
+ The entire simulation ends when either one of the objects collide.
